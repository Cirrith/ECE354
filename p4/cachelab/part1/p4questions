Sample command line:
/p/course/cs354-common/public/cache/pin -t /p/course/cs354-common/public/cache/source/tools/Memory/obj-ia32/allcache.so -is 16384 -ia 1 -ib 64 -ds 16384 -da 1 -db 64 -- yourexe

Replace "yourexe" with the name of your executable.

For ALL cache simulations, use a capacity of 16384 bytes for both 
the I-cache and the D-cache.

-------

1.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 4 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)
	Instruction cache misses:       696
	Instruction cache references:   695399
	Data cache misses:              107246
	Data cache references:          646430


1.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 4 bytes?
	1 - 107246/646430 = .8340
	
2.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 32 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)
	Instruction cache misses:       697
	Instruction cache references:   695399
	Data cache misses:              15372
	Data cache references:          646430


2.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 32 bytes?
	1 - 15372/646430 = .9762

3.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)
	Instruction cache misses:       689
	Instruction cache references:   695399
	Data cache misses:              8934
	Data cache references:          646430

	
3.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	1 - 8934/646430 = .9862

4. (to be answered without running pin)
   For this question, assume that the 100,000 elements long integer array that you allocated starts at address 0x50000000 in memory,
   the size of an integer is 4 bytes  and the D-cache is initially empty. 
   As you READ the integers in the array one-by-one, starting at index 0, 
   how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 40 integers when the cache block size is:
   a) 4 bytes: 40
   b) 32 bytes: 5
   c) 64 bytes: 3

5. Based on simulations you ran for questions 1, 2 and 3, which block size is best for the D-cache?  Why? In what way does the block 
   size affect the hit ratio for this program?
	The one with a block size of 64 bytes was best because it load more of the next sequential blocks when it gets a cache miss. 
	So when it misses the first one it loads the value it missed the next 15 values, making the next 15 sequential values hits.

cache2Drows
-----------

6.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)
	Instruction cache misses:       690
	Instruction cache references:   18122422
	Data cache misses:              106860
	Data cache references:          13567436


6.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	1 - 106860/13567436 = .9921

cache2Dcols
-----------

7.1 What do you get from running pin with a block size of 64 bytes? (Pasting the output here is fine!)
	Instruction cache misses:       690
	Instruction cache references:   18099922
	Data cache misses:              1507308
	Data cache references:          13549936


7.2 Calculate the hit ratio for the D-cache with a block size of 64 bytes?
	1 - 1507308/13549936 = .8887

Comparison of cache2Drows and cache2Dcols
-----------------------------------------
8. (to be answered without running pin) 
    For this question, assume that the 2-D integer array you allocated starts at address 0x40000000 in memory,
    the size of an integer is 4 bytes, D-cache block size is 64 bytes and the D-cache is initially empty.
    As you READ the integers in the 2-D array one-by-one, starting with element array[0,0],
    how many D-cache misses will you see for reading the first 10 integers in case of:
    a) cache2Drows: 1
    b) cache2Dcols: 10

9. Compare the performance (hit ratios) of the D-cache for the 2 programs based on simulations of questions 6 and 7.
    Explain any difference/ lack of difference that you observe. Your answer should be in the form of "There is a difference/no difference BECAUSE ____".
	There is a difference BECAUSE the cols program isn't loading the data that is going to use next while the rows program, which has a better spacial 
	locality, is loading the next 15-ish values that it will use.
